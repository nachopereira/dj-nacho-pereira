## How to Host on GitHub Pages

1.  **Create a GitHub account:** If you don't have one already, you'll need to create a free account on [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).
2.  **Create a new repository:** Once you have an account, create a new repository. The repository name should be `your-username.github.io`, where `your-username` is your GitHub username.
3.  **Upload your website files:** Upload all the files from your `DJ NACHO PEREIRA` folder to this new repository. You can do this by using the "Add file" -> "Upload files" option in your repository.
4.  **Enable GitHub Pages:** Go to the "Settings" tab of your repository and scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. Select the `main` branch as the source and click "Save".

After a few minutes, your website will be live at `https://your-username.github.io`.
